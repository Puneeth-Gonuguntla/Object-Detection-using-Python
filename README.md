# YOLO: Next-Generation Object Detection and Image Segmentation ðŸš€
Welcome to the YOLOv8 repository! This project provides a state-of-the-art implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) by uprading its existing version YOLOv7 to YOLOv8 (Version 8) - a high-performance, real-time object detection and segmentation framework.

Developed by our team, YOLOv8 offers improved accuracy, faster inference, and enhanced versatility compared to its predecessors. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this repository is your one-stop destination for leveraging YOLOv8 in your projects.

# ðŸŒŸ Features
Enhanced Accuracy: Utilizes advanced architectural innovations to achieve superior precision and recall.
Real-Time Performance: Optimized for deployment on edge devices and GPUs for real-time inference.
Modular Design: Supports a variety of tasks, including object detection, image classification, and segmentation.
Pretrained Models: Includes pretrained weights for a range of datasets like COCO, VOC, and custom datasets.
Extensibility: Designed for easy customization and fine-tuning on custom datasets.
Framework Support: Seamless integration with PyTorch and ONNX for diverse deployment needs.

# ðŸ“¦ Installation
Follow these steps to set up the repository:

1. Clone the Repository
a. bash
b. Copy code
c. git clone [https://github.com/Puneeth-Gonuguntla/yolov8.git](https://github.com/Puneeth-Gonuguntla/Object-Detection-using-Python.git)
d. cd yolov8

2. Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. (Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment
For better dependency management, consider using a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv yolov8-env
source yolov8-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: yolov8-env\Scripts\activate

# ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Run Pretrained Models
Use the pretrained YOLOv8 models to detect objects in an image:
bash
Copy code
python detect.py --weights yolov8n.pt --source path/to/image.jpg

2. Train on Custom Datasets
Fine-tune YOLOv8 on your dataset:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data data.yaml --weights yolov8n.pt --epochs 50

3. Export Models for Deployment
Export trained models to ONNX, TensorFlow, or other formats:
bash
Copy code
python export.py --weights yolov8n.pt --include onnx
